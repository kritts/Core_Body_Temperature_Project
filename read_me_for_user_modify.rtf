For n_moving_stdev and n_pt_mavg, the number you input determines your moving average/moving standard deviation. Your number MUST be greater than one or the program will stop. If you enter an even number, the program will take (your number divided by 2) before the point it\'92s analyzing, and (your number divided by 2) after the point it\'92s analyzing as well as the point it\'92s analyzing. If you choose an odd number, 9 for example, it will take 4 before and 4 after the point in question while including the point in question.\
